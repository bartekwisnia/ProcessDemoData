# Process Demo Data

Backend in Django for Process Demo Project. It stores users, users' factory simulation designs, functions and recipes

## Description

Process Demo project is a simple simulation of a process automation plant. User can design its plant/factory made of
tanks, pipes, valves etc. use prepared automated functions. The plant is simulates media flow, levels, temperatures,
pressure etc.

Project was done as a demo to my portfolio to show my programming skills and as I am an automation engineer I have
decided to do something that might be useful for me as well. I would like to use this project to explain my kids what
my work is all about and maybe inspire some softwarehouse to give me a chance in a role of a software developer.

This part is a backend of the project. It is using rest API to communicate with a frontend which is done in React
